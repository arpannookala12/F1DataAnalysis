To publish the website, we utilized the Quarto Publish GitHub Action, which streamlined the process of generating and deploying the website directly from our GitHub repository. This action automatically builds the website from our Quarto files and publishes it online for easy access.

Whenever a commit is pushed to the main branch: Our website is updated automatically
