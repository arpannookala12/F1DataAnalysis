All the work done under this section can be found in `clean.ipynb`.

The process is as follows:
- Merge the 4 chosen datasets on the common identifier.
- Compute performance metrics
- Impute missing values using Scikit's inbuilt functions
- The goal is to predict the total number of points
- We use RandomForestRegressor here for modeling

# Let's look at the Actual vs predicted total points
