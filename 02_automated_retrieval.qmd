# Fetching Data from the API

The code snippets attached below showcase the scenario where we wish to call the most recent race from the current Formula 1 season.


# Race Results JSON dump
```{python}
import requests
# Race Results
race_results_url = 'http://ergast.com/api/f1/current/last/results.json'
response = requests.get(race_results_url)
data = response.json()
races = data['MRData']['RaceTable']['Races']
print(races)
```

# Qualifying Results JSON dump
```{python}
# Qualifying Results
qualifying_results_url = 'http://ergast.com/api/f1/current/last/qualifying.json'
response = requests.get(qualifying_results_url)
data = response.json()
quali = data['MRData']['RaceTable']['Races']
print(quali)
```

# Pit Stops JSON dump
```{python}
# Pit Stops
pit_stops_url = 'http://ergast.com/api/f1/current/last/pitstops.json'
response = requests.get(race_results_url)
data = response.json()
pitstops = data['MRData']['RaceTable']['Races']
print(pitstops)
```

# Constructor Standings JSON dump
```{python}
# Constructor Standings
constructor_standings_url = 'http://ergast.com/api/f1/current/last/constructorStandings.json'
response = requests.get(constructor_standings_url)
data = response.json()
standings = data['MRData']['StandingsTable']['StandingsLists']
standings1 = data['MRData']['StandingsTable']['StandingsLists']
print(standings)
```
