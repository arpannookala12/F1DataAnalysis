title: "5: Data cleaning"
---

In terms of Data Cleaning, we just had to get rid of any unnecessary extra columns being created in the data extraction process.

<!-- For handling missing values we used the following simple procedure -->

<!-- ```python
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer

# Imputing missing values
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='median')
X_imputed = imputer.fit_transform(X)
``` -->

The entire process can be found in `clean.ipynb`
